# Quiz-Game
This is a quiz app made with basic JavaScript.


## Usage
- This app was made with basic JavaScript and vanilla CSS to demonstrate some ways to manipulate HTML elements
using very simple JS logic.

- [The live app can be found here ](https://will-rd.github.io/Quiz-Game/)

- For a more in depth view, open the app in google chrome and right click on the page and then click inspect.

- This will open DevTools to the Elements tab. Here you can watch the elements being rendered in real time as you progress through the quiz.

- If you click the Console tab beside the Elements tab you can see when each new function begins and when correct or incorrect answers are being clicked.


## Future Plans
- This app is currently at a minimum viable product level and I will update periodically. You can contact me at wdputnam42@gmail.com
